        <p>After years of being known on the VATSIM network as CZWG, we're finally changing things up. Starting on March 25th, 2021, - <text class="font-weight-bold">we're changing our callsign from CZWG to WPG.</text> Here's what that means for you - whether you're a pilot, controller, or just an observer.</p>

        <div class="tab-content" id="myTabContent">
            <div class="tab-pane fade show active" id="pilots" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="pilots" style="padding-left: 1.3%"><br>
            <div class="row">
                <h5>If you're a pilot who's flown in Winnipeg's airspace before, you should note a few small changes you'll probably see.</h5>
            </div><br>
            <li>Winnipeg Centre (previously shown on pilot clients as "CZWG_CTR") will now be shown as "WPG_CTR". The main frequency for CTR will not change (124.00).</li>
            <br>
            <li>You may encounter multiple Centres on at once (eg. WPG_L_CTR, WPG_H_CTR). These are new splits created to ease controller stress during high-traffic events. Controllers will advise you which CTR to contact, don't worry.</li>
        </div>

        <div class="tab-pane fade" id="home" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="home" style="padding-left: 1.3%"><br>
            <div class="row">
                <h5>So you're a Winnipeg Controller! Here's what you need to know.</h5>
            </div><br>
            <li>Centre callsigns are changing - if you're a Centre controller (or are certified or training for CTR), you'll be logging on as WPG_CTR from now on - so long, CZWG_CTR.</li>
            <br>
            <li>New sector files are here, and they are beautiful. Say goodbye to those ugly, outdated ground screens. We've rebuilt everything from the ground up.</li>
            <br>
            <li>If you're a Centre controller (or, as previously mentioned, are certified or training for CTR), you may see a few new additions to your sectors - Class G as well as many small fields are now showing!</li>
            <br>
            <li>Centre has new splits! We've finally added more splits to CTR for higher-traffic events (or if you want to go on a strange CTR, for whatever reason.) They are as follows:</li>
            <br>

            <br></br>
            <p><text class="font-weight-bold">NOTE:</text> There are a handful of sectors that cover others when they are offline, as well as new details on splitting CTR - make sure to take a look at Winnipeg's <a href="{{ route('policies') }}">Standard Operating Procedures</a> for details.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="tab-pane fade" id="neighbours" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="neighbours" style="padding-left: 1.3%"><br>
        <div class="row">
                <h5>Hello, Neighbouring FIR/ARTCCs! (Drinks are on us for making you change things.)</h5>
            </div><br>
            <li>Whenever you're looking for Winnipeg Centre on your end - don't look for CZWG_CTR anymore. Winnipeg will now show as WPG_CTR. The main frequency is still 124.00.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Winnipeg has (finally) implemented new CTR splits for our controllers - these can all be found in Winnipeg's <a href="{{ route('policies') }}">Standard Operating Procedures, section 2.3.4.</a></li>
            <br>
            <li>Winnipeg controllers will advise all neighbouring FIR/ARTCCs of where to handoff to, if CTR is split.</li>
