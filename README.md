- Be sensible, and don't spam with unnecessary issues.
- Tell us:
  - What is the issue/feature?
  - Why does it need to be fixed/why is it important to add?
  - How can we reproduce the issue? (if it is a bug)
  - What have you already tried? (if it is a bug)

Guidelines for submitting a **pull request**:
- Be sensible as stated above.
- Tell us:
  - What you have fixed/added and where you fixed it
  - Why it was a problem, or why it was neccessary/nice to add
